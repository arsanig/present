## Present 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️

Present is a classroom management project that I'm working on to practice/revisit making fullstack applications. 

Usually I'll start a project like this but never finish it, let alone polish it. Let's not forget testing it too! In addition, I'll probably learn more about some of the tech I'm using.

### ✔ Only feature list I'm targeting:
- User roles: Teacher & Student
- Users can modify their account information
- Teachers can view classes they teach, students within those classes, and modify the class list
- Teachers can also take attendance
- Students can view the classes they're a part of and other students within those classes
- Students can view announcements (postable by teachers) per class

### 🙃 For fun in order:
1. Teachers can export class list as CSV
2. Containerize this *****
3. Throw branding all over it (colour schemes, logos)
